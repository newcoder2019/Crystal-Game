## Game Overview

In the Crystal Matching Game, you will be presented with a grid of colored crystals. Your objective is to click on two crystals to reveal their colors. If the two revealed crystals have the same color, they will remain visible, and you will earn a point. If they have different colors, they will flip back face down, and you'll need to try again. The game continues until you've matched all the pairs or until you decide to reset and start over.
